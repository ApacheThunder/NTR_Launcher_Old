Arm7 binary patcher for allowing incompatible arm7 code/ram entry addresses to work on 3DS by patching Arm7 to relocate back to correct address after launching.

This resolves issues that would occur if you only updated the Arm7 code/ram entry address settings in the header. The arm7 binary needs to be patched too!

Big thanks to Fix94 who made this!
